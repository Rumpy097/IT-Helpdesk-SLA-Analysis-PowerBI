# IT Help Desk SLA Performance Analysis (Power BI) Overview

This project analyzes IT Help Desk ticket data to evaluate SLA compliance, breach patterns, and resolution efficiency. The dashboard is designed to answer executive, operational, and analytical questions using a multi-page Power BI report.

**Business Questions**
- How well are SLAs being met overall?
- Which departments and priorities struggle most with SLA compliance?
- Where are SLA breaches coming from?
- How severe are delays when SLAs are missed?

**Dashboard Pages**
- Executive SLA Overview – High-level SLA performance by department and priority
- Operational Breakdown – Where SLA breaches occur and their impact
- SLA Breach Drivers & Resolution Efficiency – Patterns behind breaches and delay behavior
- SLA Performance (Detailed View) – Drill-down view by resolver and requester seniority

**Key Insights**
- Overall SLA compliance is ~57%, indicating improvement opportunities.
- Infrastructure-related tickets contribute the highest breach volume and delay.
- Medium and slight breaches dominate SLA failures, suggesting systemic delays.
- Higher priority does not consistently result in better SLA compliance. Request-type tickets drive more SLA breaches than issue-type tickets.

**Tools Used**
- SQL (data preparation and KPI validation)
- Power BI
- DAX
- Excel
  
**Notes**
- The dataset is synthetic and created for portfolio purposes.
- The focus is on analysis and visualization, not data collection.
